# Instructions

You can host these files on a static web server without modification to provide documentation for your project. Alternatively, if you only need local access...

1. Start the local webserver
	* on a Mac (and probably linux), double click `startLocalServer.command`
	* No idea about Windows, but who cares about those doofuses.
1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8000`
	* for Mac, there's a `localhost.webloc` file you can just open.
