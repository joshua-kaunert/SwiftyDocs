/**
This is where the documentation data will spend most of its time. The data is first imported through the `InputDoc` struct before sitting here until it finally gets exported.

This data type is recursive and can contain children of the same type. As `SwiftDocItem` represents all entities from a class to class/struct properties to a global function and everything in between, it needs to be able to contain the items that descend from it. (A class's properties and methods, for example)
